# Midnight Drive — A Neo-Noir for the Summer

Midnight Drive blends classic noir sensibilities with modern pacing. The film follows an ex-detective drawn back into a city of neon and rain, chasing a mystery that is as much about memory as it is about crime.

The director uses long, unbroken takes to build tension and to let the actors quietly reveal their scars. The lead performance is restrained but powerful, carrying the emotional weight of the story.

Technical highlights:
- Cinematography: moody and precise
- Sound design: restrained and effective
- Production design: modern noir with tactile detail

## Rating: 4/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐
